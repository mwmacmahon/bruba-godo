  Send continuation packet loading instructions to three agents. For each, use sessions_send to their main session:

  1. sessions_send to bruba-main:main — "Load your continuation packet. Read memory/CONTINUATION.md and use it to restore context from your previous session. Reply NO_REPLY when done."

  2. sessions_send to bruba-rex:main — "Load your continuation packet. Read memory/CONTINUATION.md and use it to restore context from your previous session. Reply NO_REPLY when done."

  3. sessions_send to bruba-guru:main — "Load your continuation packet. Read memory/CONTINUATION.md and use it to restore context from your previous session. Reply NO_REPLY when done."

  Reply NO_REPLY when all three messages are sent.
