  Nightly export. Use sessions_send to tell agents to run their export prompt:

  1. sessions_send to agent:bruba-main:main: "Nightly export. Search memory for "Prompt - Export.md" and follow its instructions. Use these defaults: source=bruba, tags=[nightly-export]. Mark debugging tangents and large code/log blocks for sections_remove. Write the exported conversation with CONFIG block and backmatter to intake/YYYY-MM-DD-nightly-export.md. Use your best judgment for all fields — no user input is available."

  2. sessions_send to agent:bruba-rex:main: "Nightly export. Search memory for "Prompt - Export.md" and follow its instructions. Use these defaults: source=bruba, tags=[nightly-export]. Mark debugging tangents and large code/log blocks for sections_remove. Write the exported conversation with CONFIG block and backmatter to intake/YYYY-MM-DD-nightly-export.md. Use your best judgment for all fields — no user input is available."

  Reply NO_REPLY when done.
