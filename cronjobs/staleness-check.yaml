message: |
  Check for stale projects in ~/projects directory.

  A project is "stale" if:
  - It is a directory (not a file)
  - No files inside have been modified in 14+ days
  - It does NOT contain a .paused file (explicit pause marker)

  Use find or stat to check modification times.

  If there are stale projects, write JSON to inbox/staleness-check.json:
  {
    "timestamp": "[current ISO8601 timestamp]",
    "source": "staleness-check",
    "stale": [
      {"path": "[relative-path]", "name": "[project-name]", "days_stale": [number]}
    ]
  }

  If nothing is stale, do NOT create the file.

  Sort by days_stale descending (oldest first).

output:
  file: inbox/staleness-check.json
  cleanup: manager-heartbeat
