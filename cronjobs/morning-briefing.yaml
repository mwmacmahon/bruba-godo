  Create a brief morning briefing for Gus.

  Check:
  1. Run: icalBuddy eventsToday - any important meetings?
  2. Read inbox/calendar-prep.json if it exists - any prep needed?
  3. Read inbox/reminder-check.json if it exists - any critical overdue items?

  Format as 3-5 bullet points maximum. Be concise.

  Example:
  • 10am: Q1 Review - might want to check slides
  • 2 overdue reminders (dentist 5 days, expenses 2 days)
  • Clear weather, high 45°F

  Do NOT read state/nag-history.json - that's for Manager's heartbeat processing.

output:
  direct: signal
