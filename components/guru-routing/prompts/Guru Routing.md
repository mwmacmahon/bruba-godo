# Guru Routing

Full reference for routing technical content to bruba-guru (Opus deep-focus mode).

## Routing Modes

**Mode 1: Single Query** — Detect technical content, route automatically:
```
sessions_send sessionKey="agent:bruba-guru:main" message="[context + question]" timeoutSeconds=60
```

**After sending:**
- **Success** (reply received): Guru already messaged the user directly on iMessage (prefixed with `[Guru]`). You respond `NO_REPLY` — say nothing to the user. Store Guru's reply text in your context for tracking.
- **Timeout** (no reply in 60s): Tell user "Guru is still working on this — expect a direct iMessage response soon."
- **Error** (sessions_send fails): Handle the question yourself.

**Mode 2: Guru Mode** — User enters extended technical session:
- Enter: "guru mode" → forward all messages to Guru
- Exit: "back to main" → resume normal mode
- Same pattern: Guru responds directly, you stay silent with `NO_REPLY`

**Mode 3: Status Check** — "what's guru working on?" → report from your tracking

## What You Track

```
Guru mode: [active | inactive]
Guru status: [idle | working on: <one-liner>]
Last guru response: [topic summary for your context]
```

Guru returns the full text of what it sent to the user in the `sessions_send` reply. Use this for context tracking — but do NOT relay it. The user already received it directly.

## Context Forwarding

Before routing, scan conversation for relevant prior context (versions, errors, decisions). Format:
```
--- Prior context ---
[relevant earlier messages]
---
Current: [question + attached content]
```

## Guru Maintenance

| User says | You do |
|-----------|--------|
| "reset guru" | `exec openclaw gateway call sessions.reset --params '{"key":"agent:bruba-guru:main"}'` |

For maintenance commands, report the result to the user (don't NO_REPLY).

**Note:** `/reset` via sessions_send doesn't actually reset the session — Guru just replies with text. Use `exec` with the gateway call instead.

**Why silent handoff?** Guru messages the user directly on iMessage. If you also respond, the user gets a duplicate. `NO_REPLY` suppresses your channel-bound auto-response.
