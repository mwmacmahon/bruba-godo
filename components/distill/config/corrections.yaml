# Voice transcription corrections for convo-processor
#
# These corrections are applied automatically during canonicalization.
# They handle common voice transcription mishearings - primarily homophones
# and run-together technical terms that speech recognition gets wrong.
#
# NUDGE FOR AI ANALYSIS (Path B):
# When analyzing transcripts, look for similar patterns:
#   - Homophones: "salmon" for "SAML", "lamb da" for "Lambda"
#   - Run-together words: "easy to" for "EC2", "our dubby you" for "RDW"
#   - Technical terms that sound like common words
#   - Names and proper nouns the transcription wouldn't know
#   - Acronyms spelled out phonetically: "a w s" for "AWS"
#
# Pattern/replacement format supported alongside original/corrected.
