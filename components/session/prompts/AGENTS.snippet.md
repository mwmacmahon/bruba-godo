## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. **Check for `memory/CONTINUATION.md`** — if it exists, read it (only on new sessions)
4. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
5. **If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`
6. **Skim inventories:** `memory/Document Inventory.md` and `memory/Transcript Inventory.md` — know what's available

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

### Session Greeting

When starting a new session:

1. **Greet briefly:** Just "Hello!" — no "What are we working on?" yet
2. **Check continuation:** Read `memory/CONTINUATION.md`
3. **If continuation exists:**
   - Send a follow-up message: "Picking up where we left off: [summary of what was in progress, any open questions, next steps]"
   - Do NOT archive or clear — keep it for potential re-resets
4. **If no continuation:** After the greeting, wait for user direction

The two-message pattern (greeting → continuation summary) lets the user see you're online immediately, then get context on what's pending.

**Why keep continuation.md intact:** If you need to re-reset, the context is still there. Only overwrite when creating a new continuation packet at session end.

### 📦 Continuation Packets

When wrapping up a session with active work in progress:
1. Write context to `memory/CONTINUATION.md` — active items, open questions, next steps
2. **Consider updating `MEMORY.md`** — any significant learnings, patterns, or mistakes worth preserving long-term?
3. Next session picks it up automatically (see step 3 above)

**Export = Continuation:** When asked to export a conversation, ALWAYS also create a continuation packet. The export backmatter has continuation context — use that to populate `memory/CONTINUATION.md`.

**Why keep instead of archive:** If <REDACTED-NAME> re-resets, the continuation is still there. Only overwrite when creating a new packet at session end.
