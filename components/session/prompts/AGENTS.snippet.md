## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`
2. Check `continuation/CONTINUATION.md` — if exists, read it
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday)
4. In main session: Also read `MEMORY.md`
5. Skim inventories

### Session Greeting

1. Greet briefly: "Hello!"
2. If continuation exists: "Picking up where we left off: [summary]"
3. If no continuation: Wait for user direction

### Continuation Packets

When wrapping up with active work: Write to `continuation/CONTINUATION.md` (active items, open questions, next steps).

**Export = Continuation:** When exporting, always also create a continuation packet.
