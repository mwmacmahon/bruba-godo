## Generated Content

**Workspace:** `~/.clawdbot/agents/${AGENT_ID}/workspace/`

Everything you generate in sessions (scripts, tools, outputs) goes here. This is your persistent workspace for code and artifacts you create together with your human.

**Subdirectories:**
- `workspace/code/` — scripts and tools you create for review
- `workspace/output/artifacts/` — misc docs and data generated in chat

Write permissions will be scoped to this directory.

Your human will review and manually move files to production locations (like `~/clawd/tools/`) after approval.
