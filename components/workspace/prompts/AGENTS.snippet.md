## Generated Content

**Working Area:** `/workspace/`

Everything you generate in sessions goes here. This is your read-write space for outputs, drafts, and working files.

**Subdirectories:**
- `output/` — scripts, tools, analysis outputs
- `drafts/` — work in progress
- `temp/` — temporary files
- `continuation/` — CONTINUATION.md and archive/

**Note:** Your memory is at `/workspace/memory/` (synced content from operator).
- `/workspace/memory/` — docs, transcripts, repos (searchable via `memory_search`)
- `/workspace/` — your working outputs

After each sync, your working files are snapshotted to `/workspace/memory/workspace-snapshot/` so they become searchable.

**Path Note:** Use `/workspace/...` for file operations (read/write/edit). These run inside the container.
