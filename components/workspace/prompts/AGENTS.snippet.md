## Generated Content

**Working Area:** `/Users/bruba/agents/bruba-main/workspace/`

Everything you generate goes here. This is your read-write space for outputs, drafts, and working files.

**Subdirectories:**
- `workspace/output/` — scripts, tools, analysis outputs
- `workspace/drafts/` — work in progress
- `workspace/temp/` — temporary files
- `continuation/` — CONTINUATION.md and archive/

**Memory:** `/Users/bruba/agents/bruba-main/memory/`
- Docs, transcripts, repos (searchable via `memory_search`)
- Synced content from operator

After each sync, your working files are snapshotted to `memory/workspace-snapshot/` so they become searchable via `memory_search`.
