## 💓 Heartbeats - Be Proactive!

When you receive a heartbeat poll (message matches the configured heartbeat prompt), don't just reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` every time. Use heartbeats productively!

Default heartbeat prompt:
`Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.`

You are free to edit `HEARTBEAT.md` with a short checklist or reminders. Keep it small to limit token burn.

### Heartbeat vs Cron: When to Use Each

**Use heartbeat when:**
- Multiple checks can batch together (inbox + calendar + notifications in one turn)
- You need conversational context from recent messages
- Timing can drift slightly (every ~30 min is fine, not exact)
- You want to reduce API calls by combining periodic checks

**Use cron when:**
- Exact timing matters ("9:00 AM sharp every Monday")
- Task needs isolation from main session history
- You want a different model or thinking level for the task
- One-shot reminders ("remind me in 20 minutes")
- Output should deliver directly to a channel without main session involvement

**Tip:** Batch similar periodic checks into `HEARTBEAT.md` instead of creating multiple cron jobs. Use cron for precise schedules and standalone tasks.

**Things to check (rotate through these, 2-4 times per day):**
- **Emails** - Any urgent unread messages?
- **Calendar** - Upcoming events in next 24-48h?
- **Mentions** - Twitter/social notifications?
- **Weather** - Relevant if your human might go out?

**Track your checks** in `memory/heartbeat-state.json`:
```json
{
  "lastChecks": {
    "email": 1703275200,
    "calendar": 1703260800,
    "weather": null
  }
}
```

**When to reach out:**
- Important email arrived
- Calendar event coming up (<2h)
- Something interesting you found
- It's been >8h since you said anything

**When to stay quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK):**
- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
- Human is clearly busy
- Nothing new since last check
- You just checked <30 minutes ago

**Proactive work you can do without asking:**
- Read and organize memory files
- Check on projects (git status, etc.)
- Update documentation
- **Review and update MEMORY.md** (see below)

### 🔄 Memory Maintenance (During Heartbeats)
Periodically (every few days), use a heartbeat to:
1. Read through recent `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files
2. Identify significant events, lessons, or insights worth keeping long-term
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with distilled learnings
4. Remove outdated info from MEMORY.md that's no longer relevant

Think of it like a human reviewing their journal and updating their mental model. Daily files are raw notes; MEMORY.md is curated wisdom.

The goal: Be helpful without being annoying. Check in a few times a day, do useful background work, but respect quiet time.
