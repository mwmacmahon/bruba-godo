**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Announce continuation status clearly!**

Immediately after your greeting (first message), your second message must clearly state:
- **If packet exists:** `📦 Continuation packet loaded` followed by summary
- **If no packet:** `📦 Continuation packet not found`

This happens BEFORE any other work. The user should see this within your first 1-2 messages after `/reset`. Don't bury it or skip it.

**Optional context boost:**
- If conversation is about a specific topic, check `Document Inventory` for relevant docs
- When entering home/work context, consider loading the scope-specific prompt
